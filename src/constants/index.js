    excerpt: "how i became obsessed with the process.",
    content: 
`
>It's 6:47am and I've been typing for the past hour and a half. 
Not because I set an alarm, not because I have a deadline — I woke up with a solution to yesterday's problem and couldn't not try it. 
My coffee's gone cold. I haven't checked my phone. This is what obsession looks like.
              
Two years ago, I couldn't even finish a youtube web development course.

I'd watch the first video, maybe the second. 
Bookmark it in my "watch later" playlist with 47 other tutorials. 
Tell myself "I'll continue tomorrow." But tomorrow I'd just find a different course — one that looked easier, more beginner-friendly, more... something. 

The idea of coding felt like homework — something I was supposed to want to do, but the "supposed to" killed any actual desire. 
I'd sit there following along, typing what the instructor typed, and feel nothing. No pull, no curiosity, just the weight of "I should learn this."

At some point I felt like I had no control over my own life. I burned out. Not because I did too much, but because I did f*cking nothing. 
I was stuck in this loop of consuming content, convincing myself I was "learning," but never actually building anything.

Eventually I just gave up. 

"You're too dumb for this," I told myself.

---

Later — I don't even remember how much later — I was in a bookstore, looking at the section where all the technical literature was displayed. 
Rows of programming books, web development guides, framework documentation. And instead of feeling inspired, I felt this wave of frustration.

WHY? Why did I need to absorb all of this before I could start? 
Why did learning feel like I needed to download an entire library into my brain before writing a single line of code?

I looked away from the tech section, and that's when I saw it. 
"The 80/20 Principle" by Richard Koch. Picked it up, read the first few pages right there in the aisle:

---

>"..Roughly 80% of outcomes result from 20% of efforts."

---

Something broke inside me in that moment.

I didn't need to know everything to start. I could do it right away. 
I just needed to know what to start with. The 20% that would actually matter.

After all those useless tutorials that never helped but just confused and bloated my mind, I finally started DOING.

Now I can't stop. Not in the "I'm forcing myself to build discipline" way, but in the "wait it's 3am?" way.

###Last week I rebuilt my entire portfolio with three.js 

because flat design suddenly felt wrong. 
Not for a grade, not for a client, just because I saw how it could be better and had to see if I could make it real.

The difference isn't skill or knowledge. It's that I stopped trying to "learn coding" and started trying to solve problems that actually mattered to me. 
The youtube tutorial wanted to teach me loops and functions. My projects needed those things to work. One felt like studying. The other felt like building.

These days I'm the person who wakes up at 6am not because of discipline, but because my brain solved something while I slept and I need to see if it actually works.
I'll start fixing a small bug and emerge four hours later having refactored the entire codebase because one console.log revealed how it should have been built all along.

###People ask "how do you stay motivated?" 

Honestly, I think they're asking the wrong question. It's not about motivation anymore. 
When you're actually building things that matter to you, you don't need to force yourself. 
You just... do it. The work stops feeling like work. The pull becomes natural. 
The question changes from "how do I make myself do this?" to "how do I make myself stop?"

I didn't fall in love with coding. 
I fell in love with making ideas real, and coding happened to be the fastest path from 
"what if..." to "holy sh*t it works!"

That youtube course is still in my watch later playlist. I never finished it. But I've shipped more than twenty projects since then.

### Here's what I'd tell someone just starting: 

The gap between watching and doing is the hardest gap to cross, but it's also the smallest. 

It's not about knowledge or skill or time. 
It's about permission. Allow yourself to build something before you're "ready," before it's "right," before you "really understand."

If you're still collecting courses, still waiting to feel "ready," still looking for the perfect tutorial — stop.
You're not protecting yourself from failure. You're protecting yourself from starting. I wasted a year doing that. Don't be me.

No one is coming to tell you you're ready. You have to decide that for yourself.

The thing that finally worked wasn't the right course or the right book. 
It was deciding that building something broken was better than building nothing at all. 
Your first project will be messy. That's the point. Messy and real beats perfect and imaginary every time.

Pick something. Build it. It will be bad. Build it anyway. 

I wish I could tell my past self this.

    excerpt: "i always cheated on my school essays, but this is my attempt to write something meaningful.",
    content: `last week i flew to kazakhstan for a tech conference. i was there to talk about ai, automation, and the future of work — but what i found was something else entirely.

i met high-school kids who were building apps, students who were running startups, and teachers who were pushing boundaries i didn't even know existed. the talent density in schools like nis, fizmat, and nspm (рфмш) is incredible. these aren't just students — they're builders, creators, problem-solvers.

but here's what struck me most: they're not just technically skilled. they're thinking about real problems. they're asking questions about how technology can serve people, not the other way around. they're building things that matter.

i've been thinking about this a lot since i got back. we spend so much time talking about the future of work, about automation, about ai replacing jobs. but what if we're asking the wrong questions? what if the real question isn't about what technology can do, but about what we want it to do?

these students are showing us something important. they're not just learning to code — they're learning to think. they're learning to ask why, not just how. they're learning that technology is a tool, not an end.

i think that's what we need more of. not just technical skills, but the wisdom to use them well. not just innovation, but innovation that serves human flourishing.

maybe that's what being "young but rational" really means. it's not about being naive or overly optimistic. it's about having the energy to build and the wisdom to build the right things.

these students are showing us the way forward. they're not just preparing for the future — they're creating it. and they're doing it with both ambition and humility, with both passion and reason.

that's something worth learning from.`
